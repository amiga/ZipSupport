# Zip Support

This is a [Codename One](https://www.codenameone.com) library for Zip support based on the code from the [zipme](https://sourceforge.net/projects/zipme/) project. As such it carries a modified GPL license similar to the classpath exception but not similar enough to include in the core distribution.

This library can be used to enable ZIP functionality in Codename One applications.
